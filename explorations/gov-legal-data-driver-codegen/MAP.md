# gov-legal-data-driver-codegen — Map

<!--
Stage 5 (DECOMPOSE). Every major component below cites an existing in-tree
capability (verified via rg/ls 2026-06-29) or is marked NET-NEW. Decisions
Q1–Q8 are all resolved (see DECISIONS.md). This wedge graduates as ONE cohesive
multi-phase goal `goals/gov-legal-data-driver-codegen` — the phases below are
its sequenced internal slices, not separate goal packets.
-->

## Candidate goals

**Lifecycle annotation (2026-07-14):** P0, P1, and P3 are complete; P2 is
superseded into
[`goals/gov-legal-data-driver-delivery`](../../goals/gov-legal-data-driver-delivery/README.md),
which is paused on named-consumer pull. The `@beep/api-transport` promotion is
complete with `@beep/govinfo` and `@beep/ecfr` as its named consumers.

The original substrate wedge stayed one cohesive multi-phase goal so the shared
transformer, codegen tiering, and determinism gate were designed once and proven
across two reference verticals. Sibling closure now records the separately owned
delivery breadth and MCP host without reopening that substrate scope.

| Goal | Scope | Graduates as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gov-legal-data-driver-codegen` | OpenAPI→Effect-SDK codegen substrate (Schema value models + operation descriptors only) + one shared hand-authored auth/retry/cache/rate-limit transport, proven on `govinfo` (keyed) + one keyless driver, with CourtListener/DOL last on the proven rails. | ONE goal packet, four sequenced phases (P0–P3). |

### Phases (sequenced slices inside the one goal)

| Phase | Slice | Delivers | Gate to start | Cites |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | govinfo-finish + transformer-incubate | Repair `@beep/govinfo` manifest (`@beep/identity` + `@beep/schema` deps); add hand-authored client/config/auth/retry/cache/rate-limit **service** layer on top of the existing `Search` HttpApi contract + value models; **incubate the shared transformer inside govinfo** applied via `HttpApiClient.make`'s `transformClient`; api.data.gov `api_key` query-param auth via `Config.redacted("GOVINFO_API_KEY")`. | none (first slice) | runpod `Runpod.service.ts`/`Runpod.config.ts` split; govinfo `Search.http.ts`/`Search.contract.ts` + value models; `HttpClient.withRateLimiter`/`retryTransient`; `Cache.makeWith`; `HttpApiClient.transformClient`; `Config.redacted` |
| **P1** | keyless driver (eCFR or FedReg) + generator spike | Build the **2nd** driver on the raw-client (`HttpClient.mapRequest`) path with **zero auth surface**, consuming the incubated transformer (this makes it the 2nd consumer that unlocks promotion); run the `@effect/openapi-generator` Swagger-2.0 normalization spike on eCFR's `api/v1.json`, recording dialect warnings; per-driver `scripts/generate.ts` + committed spec + package-private `src/_generated/*`. | P0 green | acp `generate.ts` (`@effect/openapi-generator/JsonSchemaGenerator` → `src/_generated/`); runpod `openapi.json` + `scripts/generate.ts` bespoke renderer; box `.d.ts` parser (3rd fallback); `HttpClient.mapRequest` |
| **P2** | CourtListener + DOL authed drivers | Token-header (`Authorization: Token <key>`) and agency-native `X-API-KEY` auth families branched in the now-shared transformer; CourtListener caching **in-process/ephemeral only**; third-party legal content **excluded from committed fixtures**. | **GATED** on the data/source-terms matrix (required pre-shape research item, default-deny per Q8) + the metadata/auth-enforcement spike | shared transformer (from P0/P1); runpod/uspto `Config.redacted` secret precedent; per-driver raw-request escape hatch (runpod `RunpodRawRequest`) |
| **P3** | verify + promote | Per-package generate-first audit + CI `git diff --exit-code` drift check; pin exact versions in each codegen template; **promote the transformer to `foundation/capability/<name>`** with a README promotion record naming ≥2 current consumers (govinfo + the keyless driver). | ≥2 named importers actually consuming the transformer (the `07-non-slice-families` gate) | `standards/architecture/07-non-slice-families.md` gate; `foundation/capability/*` home convention (nlp-processing, file-processing, observability) |

## Named follow-on goals

These remain explicitly outside the original v1 substrate slice:

| Follow-on goal | Trigger / gate | Cites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`gov-legal-mcp`](../../goals/gov-legal-mcp/README.md) sibling server — **GRADUATED 2026-07-14** | The ≥2-proven-driver gate is cleared by `@beep/govinfo` plus `@beep/ecfr`. New `packages/drivers/gov-legal-mcp` package; carries the mandatory generated-tool-name collision contract (driver-prefixed stable names, `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$` normalization + length cap, duplicate detection with a checked-in collision report, integration tests against the Effect MCP JSON schemas). | Shipped `@beep/mcp-kit`, `m365-mcp`, and `uspto-mcp` conventions |
| transformer `foundation/capability` promotion record | Authored at P3 once the 2nd driver imports the incubated transformer; the formal README promotion record naming both consumers. | `standards/architecture/07-non-slice-families.md`; existing `foundation/capability/*` packages |

## First vertical slice

**P0 — govinfo-finish + transformer-incubate.** Lowest-risk first slice: the
hardest unknowns (a clean official-source contract, the value models, the single
`transformClient` generalization seam) are already half-built in `@beep/govinfo`.
Finish — do **not** restart. Concretely:

1. Repair `packages/drivers/govinfo/package.json` — it declares only `effect` but
   `src/**` already imports `@beep/identity` (10 files) and `@beep/schema`
   (multiple); add both deps. **(manifest bug, confirmed)**
2. Add a hand-authored `Govinfo.service.ts` / `Govinfo.config.ts` (NET-NEW —
   govinfo currently has **no** transport, only `domain/`) mirroring the runpod
   `*.service.ts`/`*.config.ts` split, on top of the existing `Search` contract.
3. Incubate the shared transformer inside govinfo and apply it through
   `HttpApiClient.make(api, { transformClient })`; wire `withRateLimiter` (reads
   live `X-RateLimit-*`), `retryTransient` (`Schedule.exponential` ⊕ jittered),
   `Cache.makeWith({ timeToLive })` (+10% TTL jitter), and
   `Config.redacted("GOVINFO_API_KEY")` api.data.gov auth.

Verify: a live `Search` round-trip decodes through the existing value models with
auth attached, rate-limit headers honored, and a cache hit on repeat — proving the
`transformClient` seam end-to-end on the official legal-edition source.

## Capability check

Every major component cites an existing in-tree brick (path-verified 2026-06-29)
or is marked **NET-NEW**.

### Existing bricks (reuse — verified)

- **Bespoke renderer over a checked-in spec** — `packages/drivers/runpod/openapi.json`
  (151 KB) + `packages/drivers/runpod/scripts/generate.ts` (27 KB). The Q1 tier-2 /
  CourtListener-DOL path.
- **Generated vs hand-authored transport split** —
  `packages/drivers/runpod/src/_generated/Runpod.generated.ts` vs
  `packages/drivers/runpod/src/Runpod.service.ts` + `Runpod.config.ts`. The Q2
  boundary precedent; govinfo P0 mirrors it.
- **Raw-request escape hatch** — `RunpodRawRequest` in
  `packages/drivers/runpod/src/Runpod.service.ts`. The Q7 spec-drift hatch.
- **`@effect/openapi-generator` codegen path** — `packages/drivers/acp/scripts/generate.ts`
  imports `@effect/openapi-generator/JsonSchemaGenerator` and emits into
  `src/_generated/`. Pinned `@effect/openapi-generator` `4.0.0-beta.91` (root
  `package.json:157` catalog; acp consumes `catalog:`). The Q1 tier-1 path
  (GovInfo / eCFR-behind-spike).
- **`.d.ts`-parser fallback generator** — `packages/drivers/box/scripts/generate.ts`
  parses `lib/client.d.ts`, `.d.ts` files, and `lib/managers/*.d.ts`. The Q1
  tier-3 fallback.
- **Native Effect v4 transport primitives** (`effect@4.0.0-beta.91`) —
  `HttpClient.withRateLimiter` (`node_modules/effect/dist/unstable/http/HttpClient.d.ts:743`),
  `HttpClient.retryTransient` (`:602`), `Cache.makeWith({ timeToLive })`
  (`node_modules/effect/dist/Cache.d.ts:155`), `HttpApiClient` `transformClient`
  option (`node_modules/effect/dist/unstable/httpapi/HttpApiClient.d.ts:135,176`),
  `Config.redacted` (`node_modules/effect/dist/Config.d.ts:1095`; in-driver
  precedent: runpod + uspto `*.service.ts`). The Q5 substrate — composition, not
  reimplementation.
- **Existing govinfo `Search` HttpApi contract + value models** —
  `packages/drivers/govinfo/src/domain/contracts/Search/Search.http.ts`
  (`HttpApiEndpoint.post("search", "/search")`), `Search.contract.ts` (status-coded
  `Success`/`Failure*`), and 10 value models under `domain/values/*`
  (CollectionContainer, CollectionSummary, GranuleContainer, GranuleMetadata,
  PackageInfo, SearchBody, SearchResponse, SearchResult, Sort, SummaryItem). The
  Q4 "finish, don't restart" base.
- **Bare driver skeletons (build targets)** — `packages/drivers/{courtlistener,ecfr,dol,federal-register}/src/index.ts`
  (each a single `index.ts`).
- **Promotion home + gate** — `packages/foundation/capability/*` (chalk, colors,
  file-processing, langextract, nlp-processing, observability, semantic-web) governed
  by `standards/architecture/07-non-slice-families.md` (≥2-named-consumers rule).
- **MCP sibling precedent** — `packages/drivers/m365-mcp` + `packages/drivers/nlp-mcp`
  (worked conventions for the graduated `gov-legal-mcp` goal).

### NET-NEW (no existing brick)

- **The shared auth+retry+cache+rate-limit transformer module** — a *composition*
  of the native primitives above, but the module itself does not exist yet.
  Incubated in govinfo (P0), promoted at P3. NET-NEW.
- **govinfo transport layer** — `Govinfo.service.ts` / `Govinfo.config.ts`;
  govinfo today has `domain/` only, no client/auth/transport. NET-NEW.
- **Committable GovInfo `openapi.json` spec artifact** — flagged unproven in Q1;
  govinfo's value models are hand-authored, not generated. Producing a committed
  spec for the generator path is a gate spike. NET-NEW.
- **eCFR Swagger-2.0 normalization via `@effect/openapi-generator`** — claimed but
  unproven; P1 spike with recorded dialect warnings; fall back to the bespoke
  renderer if lossy (and watch open bug #1978 lossy `httpclient` format). NET-NEW.
- **Raw-client drivers** (`HttpClient.mapRequest`) for eCFR/FedReg/CourtListener/DOL.
  NET-NEW.
- **Per-upstream data/source-terms matrix** — required pre-shape research artifact
  gating P2 (default-deny). NET-NEW.
- **CI `git diff --exit-code` codegen-drift check** — the per-package determinism
  gate wiring (no global `build → codegen` turbo edge in v1, Q7). NET-NEW.
- **`gov-legal-mcp` server** remains NET-NEW implementation owned by its
  separately graduated goal; the **transformer promotion record is complete**.

## Open risks inherited from the brief

- eCFR Swagger-2.0 normalization is unproven — run the P1 spike, record dialect
  warnings, fall back to the bespoke renderer if lossy.
- `@effect/openapi-generator` lossy `httpclient` format (open bug #1978) — validate
  any endpoint returning both `application/problem+json` and `application/json` on
  one status; this is why the bespoke renderer stays in the toolkit.
- CourtListener data-terms matrix is a required pre-shape research item — P2 stays
  default-deny (ephemeral-only cache, no committed third-party fixtures) until it
  exists.
- No `drivers/_shared` convention exists — the transformer must incubate in govinfo
  and only promote to `foundation/capability/<name>` at ≥2 named consumers.
