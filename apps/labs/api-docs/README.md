# @beep/api-docs

Lab app hosting Scalar docs UIs for every HttpApi contract and committed OpenAPI spec in the repo

## Development

```bash
bun run dev
bun run check
bun run test
bun run lint
```

This workspace is a runtime app, not a public TypeScript package. Keep app internals behind `@/*`; promote reusable contracts and domain code to slice or shared packages.
