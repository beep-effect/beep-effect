# Practice Box Onboarding Plan

## Status

Status: `in-progress`

## Phases

| Phase | Status | Goal | Exit criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 Research | complete | Inspect source hierarchy and confirm scope. | Required facts and blockers are recorded. |
| P1 Implement | complete | Make the smallest changes that satisfy `SPEC.md`. | Acceptance criteria are met. |
| P2 Verify | in-progress | Run required checks and capture evidence. | Verification is green or blockers are documented. |
| P3 Yeet: PR to mergeable | pending | Publish through yeet and drive the PR to mergeable: required checks green, review comments answered and resolved. | `mergeStateStatus` is `CLEAN`; zero unresolved review threads. |
| P4 Close | pending | Write the closeout reflection and flip packet state. | Packet status and evidence are updated; a closeout reflection exists. |

## Closeout Checklist

Before marking the packet closed:

1. Write a closeout reflection via the `/reflect` skill to
   `history/reflections/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<agent>.md`. Its YAML frontmatter must
   validate against `ReflectionFrontmatter`.
2. Run `bun run beep lint reflection-artifacts`.
3. Update `README.md` (status, latest evidence) and `ops/manifest.json` phase
   statuses + `initiative.status`.

## Execution Notes

- Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Keep `SPEC.md` normative and update it only when the contract changes.
- Keep this plan current; archive old run outputs under `history/`.
