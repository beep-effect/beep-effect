# CI Lane Economics — Spec

## Charter (inherited from ci-fleet-endgame, operator-worded)

"Endgame should just mean we don't wait 20 minutes for any job."

## Scope

Every required check lane's placement and cost: hosted ubuntu vs the
`beep-ec2-heavy` ephemeral fleet vs cache-warm free runners. Headline
offenders at split time (pre-cache p50s): Lint ~43.6m, Test Unit ~23m,
Property Laws ~22.4m on hosted.

## Constraints

- Measure before moving: the remote cache (live 2026-08-13) invalidates all
  cold-cache lane numbers. A cached lane may re-fit free hosted runners,
  attacking fleet necessity rather than adding fleet load (decision-record
  prediction).
- Fleet lanes inherit the one-job-one-VM cost model: every move to
  `beep-ec2-heavy` is EC2 minutes; the $100/mo projection and $200/mo ceiling
  from the signed decision record still govern.
- Per-slice sharding (speed-loop ledger lineage) is the lever for the
  ~9-minute type-graph import class that caching cannot touch.
- No placement change may weaken the fork-PR, cache-write, IAM, egress, or
  teardown rails.

## Exit criteria

No required job exceeds 20 minutes at p95 (attempt-one successful runs)
across a representative week of PR and push waves — the charter says no one
waits, so the tail is the gate, not the median. Per-lane placement decisions
recorded; cost within the standing budget gates; rerun/flake rates tracked
separately via the attribution rules rather than laundered into percentiles.
