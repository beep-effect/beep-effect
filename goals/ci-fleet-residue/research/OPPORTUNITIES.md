# ci-fleet-residue — friction and opportunity ledger

Record receipts at the moment friction happens; redact for the public repo.

## Seed context (2026-08-13, from the split)

- Spot evidence: 3 same-second reclaims killed 6 jobs on cutover evening
  (2026-08-11 19:49:32Z sweep); on-demand since. A calm-week baseline is the
  revert precondition.
- IMDS attribution is CONFOUNDED: the original DROP rollback blamed the
  firewall, but the toolbelt post-install reproduced the identical
  runner-start failure with no firewall (inline set -u leak). Retest
  subshell-scoped.
- Closeout writer bug field evidence: PR #668 and #673 closeouts both
  emitted reviewedHeadSha as a raw Option object.
## 2026-08-13 — mid-publish worktree writes would fail proof-changed-worktree

- What: while a `yeet publish` full proof was running for the P3 closeout
  writer fix, packet research notes were written into
  `goals/ci-fleet-residue/research/`. `validatePostCommitProofDidNotChangeWorktree`
  fails the publish when ANY staged/unstaged/untracked path exists post-proof,
  regardless of who created it — the files had to be parked in `/tmp` and
  restored after the push.
- Evidence: `packages/tooling/tool/cli/src/commands/Yeet/internal/PublishScope.ts`
  (`proof-changed-worktree` packet, "no staged, unstaged, or untracked paths
  remain").
- Prevention: snapshot the worktree's untracked/dirty set at commit time and
  fail only on paths that appeared DURING the proof (a diff of sets), or emit
  an early advisory ("worktree must stay untouched until push") when the
  publish starts. Either would let an operator/agent keep working on packet
  docs during the ~30 min proof window without poisoning the run.

## 2026-08-13 — no safe porcelain for bumping a locked transitive dep

- What: a fresh advisory (GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8, nanoid <3.3.18) failed
  `repo-sanity:bun-audit` and `pre-push:security` mid-arc — environment
  class, identical tree had passed ~40 min earlier. Remediation required
  bumping ONLY the transitive `nanoid@3.3.17` (under postcss/docx), and no
  bun porcelain does that: `bun update nanoid` silently ADDS `nanoid@^6` as
  a root direct dependency (wrong and does not fix the locked 3.3.17);
  `bun update docx` re-resolved docx's own subtree but left `postcss/nanoid`
  at 3.3.17; a root `overrides` entry would force the 5.x consumers down.
  Ended up hand-patching the `bun.lock` entry (version + registry
  `dist.integrity`) and verifying with `bun install --frozen-lockfile` +
  both security lanes.
- Evidence: bun.lock one-line diff `nanoid@3.3.17 -> 3.3.18`;
  `bun audit` / osv-scanner green after; `bun install` accepted integrity.
- Prevention: a `beep` helper (or documented recipe) for
  "bump one locked transitive to a fixed release": patch the lock entry
  with registry integrity, frozen-install to verify, run both audit lanes.
  Advisory-feed failures mid-publish are recurring; the repair should be a
  one-command ritual, not lockfile surgery.
