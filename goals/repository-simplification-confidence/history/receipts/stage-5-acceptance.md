# Stage 5 acceptance evidence — partial V contribution

This records V's local evidence only. It does not close the program or qualify
publication, hosted readiness, other lanes, or the repaired non-CLI preview.
The orchestrator owns the aggregate acceptance record.

## Package gates

| Lane | Package | Qualified source / artifact | Full package result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V | `@beep/repo-cli` | `5a79cbc49a8cd76145db5ead3157f8e0dcc18242` | PASS 757.718 s (audit 729.9 s, docgen 26.2 s) | `rsc-v-local-proof-results.json`, V handoff |
| V, prepared R105 patch | `@beep/rdf` | Original patch `b0f087e9b4addbd08cebc4c8cb4750e879a6367d8f344c6a55b278f5f77a4a92` | PASS 12.064 s | Prepared-patch evidence only; repair preview needs its own proof |
| V, prepared R105 patch | `@beep/pacer` | Same original patch | PASS 10.024 s | Prepared-patch evidence only; no second PR exists |

## Scope

V changes 78 files relative to merged main, including this partial receipt.
Only repo-cli package source/tests are edited; RDF/Pacer are preserved patches,
not package edits in the integration branch. The D13 roughly 150-file cap and
CLI-only first PR boundary remain intact. Thirty-five reviewed files match
terminal-zero source `a0b0df4147`. Main's changeset-remedy assertion and V's
new canonical plan property have separate terminal-zero Run 4 review. The
earlier 757.718-second package result belongs only to the table's recorded
`5a79cbc49a` source, including incoming Accounts code. The new full package
collector at `4be0599a18` is running; no terminal result is inferred. No source worktree or branch was retired.

Final inventory: 1,853 / 716 open / 1,137 exceptions. Historical IDs remain
immutable; the dated linkage record describes re-anchors and candidate churn.
PR #1575 is published and ready; direct capped publication passed cheap gates
and frozen-install preflight. The private repo-cli release note was archived
after D policy landed. Knowledge refs passes with zero live gated observations
after the main SPEC wording repair. Hosted readiness, new full package proof,
R102 remediation and completed-retained gates remain open.
