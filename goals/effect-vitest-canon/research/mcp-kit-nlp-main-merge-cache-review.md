# Disjoint branch and main cache review merge

Retain the branch dependency arrays reviewed in `goals/effect-vitest-canon/research/mcp-kit-main-cache-review.md`
and the independently reviewed main arrays. Three-way comparison confirms
disjoint changed computation sets and identical computation membership. Only
dependencies differ: all commands, configurations, source records, qualification
scope, profile, epoch and other metadata remain equal. No qualification is
promoted. Preserve main's existing HTML/NLP review at its original path and
record this lane-specific merged basis separately.
