# CI-Ops Ontology Pipeline

## Status

Lifecycle: `active`

Source: [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json)

## Mission

Operate the ratified CI operational ontology as a pipeline: project live admission and wave-order data through the S7 engine, hold CQ regression green, ratify auditor run 4, and state the fleet time-to-certainty verdict.

## Launch

Use this command for execution-capable sessions:

```text
/goal follow the instructions in goals/ciops-ontology-pipeline/GOAL.md
```

`GOAL.md` is the compact launcher. `SPEC.md` remains the normative contract.

## Read This First

1. [`GOAL.md`](./GOAL.md) - compact `/goal` launcher.
2. [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) - normative source of truth.
3. [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) - active execution plan.
4. [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json) - machine-readable routing.
5. [`research/`](./research/) - supporting research, if present.
6. [`history/`](./history/) - evidence and closeouts, if present.

## Current Phase

P0 Inheritance — not started.

## Latest Evidence

Not started.

## Notes

- Graduated 2026-10-01 from
  [`explorations/beep-ci-operational-ontology`](../../explorations/beep-ci-operational-ontology/README.md);
  its `BRIEF.md` and `MAP.md` are the shaped pitch and the decomposition.
  "Graduation Ruling n" is Ruling n of that packet's 2026-10-01 graduation sitting. New
  rulings land in [`research/decisions.md`](./research/decisions.md).
- The ontology tree and `research/scripts/**` stay under the exploration; this goal owns them
  by back-link (graduation Ruling 7). `ontology/extraction/**` is byte-immutable.
- Run 4 waits on the graduation Ruling 1 gate: time-to-certainty C4.1 checked plus
  post-#1321 owning-clone proof-ledger facts from both local stages.
