# Rebuild beep-effect infrastructure on Alchemy and distilled, Pulumi retired Spec

## Objective

Replace every Pulumi program under `infra/` with Alchemy stacks written as Effect code over
`alchemy`, `@alchemy.run/*` and `@distilled.cloud/*`, rebuilt from scratch under new physical
names so Alchemy owns all state, then delete `infra/`, the Pulumi CLI dependency, the TypeScript 6
pin and the Python and shell that lived there. The estate afterwards: CI runner fleet, turbo
cache, cost controls, GitHub repository settings, OIP web hosting, Storybook, and the two host
deployments (AI metrics on dankserver, OpenClaw), each a canonical `@beep/*` package or an
`alchemy.run.ts` beside its app.

Graduated 2026-11-06 from [`explorations/pulumi-to-alchemy`](../../explorations/pulumi-to-alchemy/README.md);
decisions D1–D16 in its `DECISIONS.md` (2026-11-06 session) are binding and are restated here as
constraints. Sibling packets: [`scripts-to-beep-cli`](../scripts-to-beep-cli/README.md) (owns
`beep github app mint`, the compiled `beep` binary and `scripts/` retirement) and
[`python-free-repo`](../python-free-repo/README.md) (owns the Python ban; this packet deletes
`infra/r2-cache/*.py` as part of its own cleanup).

## Non-Goals

- Changing what the infrastructure does: no new services, no hosting-platform change for OIP
  (stays on Vercel), no runner-economics change (self-hosted fleet stays).
- Adopting live Pulumi resources in place. Everything is greenfield (D12) except the singletons
  D20 lists (repository, rulesets, existing DNS records, oip.law Vercel domains, `BeepEffectWeb`
  into the shared store), each adopted per object and named in a decision file.
- Minting GitHub Apps from IaC (D10); app creation is a beep command in `scripts-to-beep-cli`.
- Porting `scripts/` or the historical Python outside `infra/` (sibling packets).
- Upstreaming providers before they are stable here (D14 says in-repo first).
- The `@alchemy.run/domain` work in `goals/alchemy-vault-sync-slice` (application domain, not IaC).

## Source Hierarchy

1. User objective or issue that created this packet.
2. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and required skills.
3. Governing architecture/package standards.
4. This `SPEC.md`.
5. `PLAN.md`.
6. `GOAL.md`.
7. Supporting `research/`, `ops/`, and `history/` files.

Higher sources outrank lower sources when they conflict.

## Target Surfaces

New (every package via `bun run beep create-package`; new tooling kind `infra`, doctrine
amendment in `standards/architecture/07-non-slice-families.md` and `DECISIONS.md`):

- `@beep/infra-ci-runners` (tooling kind `infra`): VPC, security groups, flow logs,
  the runner composite, reaper Lambda, fleet controller SSM/IAM/KMS.
- `@beep/infra-turbo-cache` (tooling kind `infra`): the Cloudflare Worker + R2
  cache moved from `scratchpad/turbo-cache-r2` (moved, then the scratchpad module is deleted).
- `@beep/infra-cost-controls` (tooling kind `infra`): budget, anomaly monitor
  and subscription, cost-allocation tags, Compute Optimizer and Cost Optimization Hub enrollment.
- `@beep/infra-github` (tooling kind `infra`): repository settings, rulesets
  (including the beep-reviewer advisory switch), Actions secrets and variables, environments,
  labels, webhooks for `beep-effect/beep-effect`.
- `@beep/infra-hosts` (tooling kind `infra`): AI metrics on dankserver via
  `Docker.Context` over SSH plus `Docker.Container`/`Network`/`Volume` (`Docker.Service` is
  swarm-only); OpenClaw via `Command.Exec` (delete is a no-op, stdout is not an output).
- `@beep/alchemy-vercel` (tooling library): `Project`, `EnvVar`,
  `Domain` resources over `@distilled.cloud/vercel`.
- `@beep/alchemy-aws-extras` (tooling library):
  `CostAllocationTag`, `ComputeOptimizerEnrollment`, `CostOptimizationHubEnrollment`,
  `RunnerLaunchTemplate` (gp3 root volume, EBS-optimised, Spot options Alchemy's
  `LaunchTemplate` lacks); `KmsGrant` only if the P2 key-policy check shows an IAM condition
  cannot replace the six grants (D19).
- `@beep/alchemy-github-runners` (tooling library): the
  runner composite (webhook, SQS, scale-up via EC2 `CreateFleet` Spot launches, scale-down,
  launch template, SSM, syncer, termination watcher; Lambdas ported to Effect and bundled by
  Alchemy, D19) with MIT attribution to `github-aws-runners/terraform-aws-github-runner`.
- an `alchemy.run.ts` beside `apps/oip-web` and beside `apps/storybook`.
- `apps/beep-effect-web/alchemy.run.ts`: state store switched to the shared S3 store.
- `.github/workflows/*`: Alchemy deploy jobs per stack (prod only from `main`, concurrency group
  per stack), fleet and cache re-enrollment.
- `docs/runbooks/`: one runbook per stack family; Pulumi runbooks deleted or rewritten.

Deleted at the end: `infra/` (every file), `scratchpad/turbo-cache-r2`, `@pulumi/*` and
`@pulumiverse/*` catalog entries, `infra/pulumi-typescript6.cjs`, the `typescript ^6` syncpack
group, `infra:prepare-gha-runners` in root `postinstall`, `infra` in root `workspaces`.

## Constraints

- Effect-first and schema-first repo laws apply to every new package exactly as to any `@beep/*`
  package: `effect/<Module>` leaf imports, `Effect.fn`/`fnUntraced`, `HashMap`/`HashSet`, no
  `node:crypto` or `node:http` where `effect/*` provides the module, no async/await outside
  framework-owned boundaries, `tsgo` diagnostics enforced, tests under `test/` with `@beep/*`
  imports, JSDoc per `.patterns/jsdoc-documentation.md`, `package-verify` before handoff.
- No Python, no shell scripts, no Markdown other than the package README and the runbook.
- Alchemy pins are npm catalog entries (`alchemy`, `@alchemy.run/*`, `@distilled.cloud/*`), bumped
  in their own PR with `alchemy plan` no-op on every stack (D13). No frozen tool clones, no git-ref
  pins. The Alchemy and distilled reference checkouts provisioned by `bun run beep refs provision`
  are for research and for proving an unreleased fix before a bump. A fix already merged upstream but
  not yet released may ride as a bun `patchedDependencies` patch on the pinned version, recorded
  in `research/t3code-alchemy-patches.md`-style notes and removed in the bump that ships it.
- Use what Alchemy and distilled ship before writing anything: the P0 "use this, never roll
  that" matrix is the gate for every new resource or helper (D16). A repo-owned resource exists
  only where the matrix records a verified gap.
- Repo-owned resources follow Alchemy's provider conventions (`infrastructure-as-code/provider`,
  `custom-provider`, `testing/testing-providers`) and the `@alchemy.run/test` harness, so the
  generic ones (Vercel, KMS Grant, cost tag, enrollments) can go upstream unchanged (D14).
- One state store: `AWS.state({ backend: "s3", encryption: <kms> })` in the existing account, new
  bucket named in the account-regional `<prefix>-<accountId>-<region>-an` form, bootstrapped once
  with Alchemy's own bootstrap commands under `AWS_PROFILE=elpresidank-vault` (D6, D17, D18).
  Every stack declares it; `prod` stages deploy only from CI under a concurrency group, except
  `@beep/infra-hosts` (D21, Exception Ledger).
- Credentials flow through `op run` with `op://` references; never `alchemy profile`, never
  checked-in ciphertext. Pulumi `secure:` values move to 1Password references (G8).
- Cutover per stack (D12): deploy beside the live Pulumi stack under new names, verify, flip,
  `pulumi stack export` archived outside the repo, `pulumi destroy`, then delete the program.
  Order: storybook, turbo cache, cost controls, GitHub, OIP, hosts, runner fleet last.
- Turbo cache requirements carried from the AWS cache and the r2 pilot (D7): per-team tokens,
  signed-policy semantics (CI writes only from protected `main` and named trusted workstations,
  same-repo PR jobs read-only, forks local-only), the cache-input baseline review
  (`infra/r2-cache/cache-input-review.md` content preserved in the package README), and a
  throttle or error-rate alarm equivalent.
- `goals/repo-cli-gh-git-consolidation` is a requirement, not a dependent (D10).
- `beep reviewer ruleset release|require` becomes a stage config flag on `@beep/infra-github`;
  the CLI stops editing rulesets once the stack owns them (D20).
- `scratchpad/turbo-cache-r2` is on branch `@chore/deps-update-11-6-26`; it must land on `main`
  before P3 moves it.
- Every irreversible step (destroying a Pulumi stack) lands its reversal path first: the exported
  state archive location and a `pulumi stack import` recipe recorded in a decision file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] P0 research reports exist under `research/` (docs catalog, source-pattern inventory,
      t3code stack patterns, blog catalog, the "use this, never roll that" matrix) and the
      matrix has been reviewed before any P1 package is scaffolded.
- [ ] Each target package exists via `create-package`, passes
      `bun run beep quality package-verify <pkg>`, and has stack tests on the `@alchemy.run/test`
      harness.
- [ ] `alchemy plan` for every stack shows no create or replace against its live stage after
      cutover, `alchemy drift` is clean, and the shared S3 state store lists every stack
      including `BeepEffectWeb` (`plan` has no changes-pending exit code; GitHub secrets
      re-upload by design).
- [ ] CI runs on the Alchemy-built runner fleet; `heavy.yml` and `check.yml` enrolled against the
      Worker turbo cache with hit evidence from a `main` run and a PR run.
- [ ] oip.law production and staging serve from the Alchemy-managed Vercel project, env vars and
      domains; DNS and the assets bucket are Alchemy-owned.
- [ ] GitHub rulesets, secrets, variables, environments and labels are reconciled by
      `@beep/infra-github` with `alchemy drift` clean.
- [ ] AI metrics and OpenClaw deploy through `@beep/infra-hosts`.
- [ ] `infra/` and `scratchpad/turbo-cache-r2` are deleted; no `@pulumi/*` in any manifest or
      lockfile; no `typescript ^6` pin; root `postinstall` no longer builds the ghaRunners SDK.
- [ ] Every Pulumi stack destroyed has a decision file naming its state export archive.
- [ ] Doctrine amended: tooling kind `infra` in `07-non-slice-families.md`, a dated entry in
      `standards/architecture/DECISIONS.md`.
- [ ] No unrelated refactors or formatting churn.

## Stop Conditions

- Required source files are missing or materially contradictory.
- Any spend: purchases, paid services, quota top-ups or plan changes need the
  operator. Brief double-running cost during a stack cutover is pre-authorised (D12).
- The same blocker repeats after reasonable investigation.

Scope growth, destructive side effects and policy calls are not stops: decide
them and record each as a decision file.

### Carry the upstream Artifacts.cached fix as a bun patch on alchemy beta.85, 2026-11-09

`alchemy@2.0.0-beta.85` leaves every later caller of a failed `Artifacts.cached` id waiting forever (`lib/Artifacts.js` resolves the `Deferred` only on success). Upstream `main` fixed it (`packages/alchemy/src/Artifacts.ts`, `Effect.onExit` with `Deferred.done`, success cached, failure evicted). The same change rides as `patches/alchemy@2.0.0-beta.85.patch` through bun `patchedDependencies`, keeping the npm pin intact (D13; `research/t3code-alchemy-patches.md`). The first bump past beta.85 drops the patch after `grep -n onExit node_modules/alchemy/lib/Artifacts.js` confirms the release carries it.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p1

Reverse: Delete patches/alchemy@2.0.0-beta.85.patch and its patchedDependencies entry in the bump PR that ships the fix.

### BeepEffectWeb re-adopts into the shared store by name, adopt only on dispatch, 2026-11-09

`BeepEffectWeb` moves from `Cloudflare.state()` to the shared S3 store by code change only (`apps/beep-effect-web/alchemy.run.ts`): Alchemy has no Cloudflare-to-AWS state migration, so the first `prod` deploy against the empty S3 stage reads every resource by name. `Cloudflare.Worker` (custom domain and redirects included) reports plain attributes, so it adopts silently; nothing in the stack is `Unowned`. The deploy workflow gains a `workflow_dispatch` input `adopt` that passes `--adopt` for the one case a read reports `Unowned`; it is never set on push. The old state objects stay in the Cloudflare Durable Object store untouched and are deleted only after the S3 plan shows no create or replace. Acceptance per the P0 note: plan shows no create or replace, `alchemy drift` clean.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p1

Reverse: Set state back to Cloudflare.state() in apps/beep-effect-web/alchemy.run.ts and drop the AWS credentials step; the Cloudflare store still holds the previous prod state.

### GitHub OIDC provider and state-only deploy role are bootstrap singletons, 2026-11-09

GitHub Actions reaches the shared state store through two bootstrap singletons created 2026-11-09 under `AWS_PROFILE=elpresidank-vault` (IAM user, account 832907639880): the OIDC provider `arn:aws:iam::832907639880:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com` (audience `sts.amazonaws.com`) and the role `arn:aws:iam::832907639880:role/beep-alchemy-state-rw` (inline policy `alchemy-state-bucket-rw`: bucket configuration reads and writes plus object get/put/delete on `alchemy-state-832907639880-us-east-1-an`, nothing else; trust restricted to `repo:beep-effect/beep-effect:environment:beep-effect-web-prod`). The ARN is the `ALCHEMY_STATE_ROLE_ARN` variable on the `beep-effect-web-prod` GitHub environment. Both carry tags `beep:owner=infra-alchemy-rebuild`, `beep:bootstrap=state-store`. Each later stack adds its environment subject to the trust policy; stacks that manage AWS resources get their own scoped deploy role. `@beep/infra-ci-runners` adopts the provider and role with `adopt(true)` in P5 (one decision file each), per D20.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p1

Reverse: aws iam delete-role-policy --role-name beep-alchemy-state-rw --policy-name alchemy-state-bucket-rw; aws iam delete-role --role-name beep-alchemy-state-rw; aws iam delete-open-id-connect-provider --open-id-connect-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::832907639880:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com; gh variable delete ALCHEMY_STATE_ROLE_ARN --env beep-effect-web-prod.

### Org runner group and GitHub App webhook URL stay outside IaC, 2026-11-09

Open question 4 of the P0 matrix. The `beep-ec2-heavy` org runner group and the GitHub App webhook URL stay outside IaC: the runner group remains an org setting recorded in the ci-runners runbook, and the App webhook URL is set by the `beep github app` command family that D10 already makes the App's owner. `@alchemy.run/github` has no runner-group or App resource and token-only credentials, so owning either means two repo resources with App-JWT auth for two objects that change once per fleet rebuild. Revisit in P5 only if a runbook step drifts in practice.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p1

Reverse: Add RunnerGroup and an App-webhook resource over distilled actions/apps to @beep/alchemy-github-runners and adopt both objects.

### Shared S3 state store: default account-regional bucket, SSE-KMS with the AWS-managed key, 2026-11-09

The shared store is the account-regional default S3 bucket `alchemy-state-832907639880-us-east-1-an` (D6, D17): `AWS.state({ backend: "s3", encryption: { sseAlgorithm: "aws:kms", bucketKeyEnabled: true, blockedEncryptionTypes: ["SSE-C"] } })`, declared in `apps/beep-effect-web/alchemy.run.ts` and copied verbatim by every later stack. Encryption is SSE-KMS with the AWS-managed S3 key rather than a customer-managed key: redacted outputs are still KMS-protected at rest, the CI state role needs no key-policy grant, and the store has no key to bootstrap before itself; a customer-managed key is a later `kmsMasterKeyId` edit (existing objects are not rewritten). Bootstrapped 2026-11-09 from `apps/beep-effect-web` with the aws-vault session exported into the environment (`eval "$(aws configure export-credentials --profile elpresidank-vault --format env)"`, `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`), then `bunx alchemy state bootstrap --no-input` and `bunx alchemy state list --no-input`; Alchemy's resolver takes environment credentials first and otherwise an Alchemy profile, never `AWS_PROFILE` on its own, and the repo uses no Alchemy profiles (no `aws login`, no `alchemy profile`). Receipt: `State store configured in 'alchemy.run.ts' is ready (v5)`; bucket verified with `aws s3api get-bucket-encryption` (aws:kms, bucket key on, SSE-C blocked), versioning and public-access block. The Lambda assets bucket (`alchemy provider aws bootstrap`, D18) is deferred to the first stack that deploys a Lambda (`@beep/infra-ci-runners`), since no earlier stack needs `AWS.providers()`.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p1

Reverse: After every stack is destroyed: bunx alchemy state teardown --backend aws --yes under the same profile; the bucket is deleted with its objects.

### Storybook deploys as a Cloudflare StaticSite, not through the Vercel provider, 2026-11-09

Open question 8 of the P0 matrix. Storybook deploys through `Cloudflare.Website.StaticSite` in `apps/storybook/alchemy.run.ts`, not through `@beep/alchemy-vercel`. The Pulumi Storybook program was never applied, so nothing is live to flip; StaticSite needs no new provider and no Vercel seat, and it matches `apps/beep-effect-web` (the one live stack, also Cloudflare). D3 scoped the Vercel resources to OIP, "and Storybook if it stays on Vercel"; it does not. `@beep/alchemy-vercel` stays exactly the three OIP resources.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p1

Reverse: Replace the StaticSite in apps/storybook/alchemy.run.ts with Vercel.Project/Domain from @beep/alchemy-vercel once that library exists; no live resource depends on the choice.

### Pin the prod Worker name; adopt-by-name needed it, 2026-11-12

Amends the decision 'BeepEffectWeb moves to the S3 store by code change only'. Its premise, that the first prod deploy against the empty S3 stage reads every resource by name and adopts silently, did not hold for the Worker: Alchemy names a Worker {stack}-{stage}-{id}-{instanceId} with a random instance id kept in state, so the empty stage minted beepeffectweb-website-prod-cbwmlwzgibgw7skx. That Worker could not take beep-effect.com from the live beepeffectweb-website-prod-lu7dco5dnf2llcs2, and Deploy beep-effect-web (prod) failed on every push from #3021 (2026-11-09) to 2026-11-12. Both Workers carry the alchemy:stack:BeepEffectWeb, alchemy:stage:prod and alchemy:id:Website tags (read 2026-11-12), and the S3 record is a creating checkpoint without attributes. With the prod name pinned, the planner's recovery read finds the orphan, the explicit name forces a replace, the replacement observes the live Worker as owned and adopts it without --adopt, and the replace then deletes the orphan. Agent-proposed with the operator's go-ahead on 2026-11-12.

Lane fix/beep-effect-web-prod-worker-name

Reverse: Remove productionWorkerName from apps/beep-effect-web/alchemy.run.ts once the S3 state holds a completed Website record; the generated name then stays authoritative.

### AI metrics resource graph: SSH Docker context, owned network, looked-up data volume, Phoenix container, Command.Exec host steps, 2026-11-13

The Pulumi program wrote a Compose file and a `systemd --user` unit over SSH and ran preflight, apply and health as remote commands. The `HostsAiMetrics` prod graph: `Docker.Context("Host")` with endpoint `host=ssh://<sshDestination>` and a pinned context name; `Docker.Network` (bridge, `beep-ai-metrics`), owned by the stack; the Phoenix data volume as `Docker.Volume.lookup` (read and mounted, never created, replaced or removed, so no plan can touch the data); `Docker.Container("Phoenix")` with the pinned image from configuration (the schema rejects `latest` and untagged images), `restart: unless-stopped`, `start: true`, `PHOENIX_WORKING_DIR=/data`, port `127.0.0.1:6006:6006` (loopback only, as in the Compose file) and a Docker healthcheck on `/healthz`; then `Command.Exec` steps over non-interactive SSH: Preflight (tools, engine, tailnet, data volume present), RetireCompose, TailscaleServe (the Pulumi apply script's port-switching logic unchanged, HTTPS 8447 to loopback 6006) and Health (Docker health is healthy, loopback answers, Serve fronts it, the public URL answers). Mapping: Compose service and `container_name` become the Container with the same name; the Compose project network becomes the stack's own network; the named Compose volume is the lookup; the systemd unit is retired, Docker's restart policy replaces it; the Tailscale Serve lines become their own step. `Docker.Service` is not used: it needs a swarm manager (D21 note). Ordering edges are Outputs (Exec `hash.input` in a later step's env, a constant container label mapped from RetireCompose), since Alchemy has no `dependsOn`. Each Exec hashes no files (`memo: { include: [], exclude: ["**"] }`), so it re-runs only when its rendered command or env changes. The two `op://` references (hash salt, raw archive key) are configuration fields the stack exports for clients; it never resolves them, and no resolved value is a prop, so none reaches state (tested).

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p4-hosts

Reverse: alchemy destroy --stage prod, then run the saved rollbackToCompose command to re-enable the archived Compose unit; the Pulumi program (infra/src/AIMetrics.ts) stays on main until P6.

### Host stack configuration is a schema-decoded JSON file per stack, named by an environment variable, 2026-11-13

No tracked file carries a host address, login, path or port. `AiMetricsHostConfig` (`packages/tooling/infra/infra-hosts/src/AiMetricsConfig.ts`) and `OpenClawStackArgs` (`packages/tooling/infra/infra-hosts/src/OpenClawGeneration.ts`) are the stack configuration schemas; `loadHostConfigFile` (`packages/tooling/infra/infra-hosts/src/HostConfigFile.ts`) reads the file named by `BEEP_AI_METRICS_HOST_CONFIG` or `BEEP_OPENCLAW_HOST_CONFIG` and decodes it, turning a missing variable, an unreadable file, malformed JSON or a rejected value into a `ConfigError` before any resource is read (tested). Machine facts (SSH destination, tailnet name, legacy Compose root, workstation identity, backup target) are required fields; this stack's own conventions (container, network, volume and context names, ports 6006 and 8447, unit name) default to what the Compose deployment uses today. The files hold `op://` references only and live on the operator workstation outside the repo. The SSH agent socket is not a field: Docker's `ssh://` endpoint and the host steps both use the deploy process's `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, which the runbook sets from the wrapped route.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p4-hosts

Reverse: Switch loadHostConfigFile to Config.schema over ConfigProvider.fromEnv with nested keys; the schemas stay the same.

### No Pulumi state exists for AI metrics or OpenClaw; the host stacks adopt what is on the host, 2026-11-13

Checked 2026-11-13 by the launching session: the Pulumi backend `s3://oip-law-pulumi-state` holds no stack for the AI metrics project and none for OpenClaw, so P4's cutover rule (export, then `pulumi destroy`) has nothing to act on for either; the programs describe deployments that exist on the hosts outside Pulumi state. Adoption therefore happens on the host, not in a state store. AI metrics: the data volume is looked up by name, the Compose container and unit are retired by the RetireCompose step, and the Tailscale Serve port state file is reused in place. OpenClaw: generations are content-addressed under the config root, so the first Alchemy apply writes a new generation directory beside any earlier ones and flips the `current` pointer through the same apply script; the snapshot and rollback paths are unchanged. The generation id changes once at this move, because the proof skill's recorded source path changed from `infra/src/OpenClawArtifacts.ts` to the new package. The Pulumi programs leave with `infra/` in P6; no `pulumi stack rm` is owed.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p4-hosts

Reverse: None needed: nothing is imported or destroyed in Pulumi. If a stack is later found in the backend, export it outside the repo and record it in a new decision before any pulumi destroy.

### Host stacks: two Alchemy stacks, prod from the workstation only, every other stage a rehearsal, 2026-11-13

`@beep/infra-hosts` holds two stacks, `HostsAiMetrics` (`packages/tooling/infra/infra-hosts/alchemy.run.ts`) and `HostsOpenClaw` (`packages/tooling/infra/infra-hosts/openclaw.alchemy.run.ts`): they target different machines (dankserver over SSH, the operator workstation under sudo), change on different cadences (a Phoenix image bump against an OpenClaw generation), and separate stacks keep separate S3 stage leases, so planning one never reads or locks the other. Stage `prod` is the only stage that mutates a real host. It runs from the operator workstation only (D21): both programs yield `WorkstationOnly` (`packages/tooling/infra/infra-hosts/src/HostsStage.ts`) before declaring a resource, a `Config` that fails with a `ConfigError` when `CI` is true, the inverse of the `Config.Literal("true", "CI")` guard the CI-deployed stacks use. The S3 store's stage lease is the overlap guard; there is no deploy workflow. Every other stage name is a rehearsal and may run anywhere: AI metrics deploys a throwaway Phoenix on stage-suffixed context, network, volume and container names on a separate loopback port, with no Compose retirement and no Tailscale Serve; OpenClaw renders the generation and declares no command. Tests: `packages/tooling/infra/infra-hosts/test/HostsStage.test.ts`, the CI cases in both stack tests.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p4-hosts

Reverse: Merge both programs into one stack in alchemy.run.ts, or drop the rehearsal branch so non-prod stages refuse; delete WorkstationOnly once a runner holds a scoped dankserver deploy key (Exception Ledger).

### OpenClaw applicator steps become ordered Command.Exec resources; checks report by exit status, 2026-11-13

The Pulumi program ran preflight, stage, apply, probe and an optional backup ship as `command.local.Command` resources with triggers, and exported the drift audit, live acceptance and rollback scripts as outputs plus each step's stdout as a secret output. `HostsOpenClaw` prod declares `Command.Exec` Preflight, Stage, Apply, Probe and (when `backup` is configured) BackupShip, in that order, each `shell: /bin/sh` over the rendered `/bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p -c '<program>'` script, with a 20-minute timeout on the long steps. Triggers map to the command text: every rendered script embeds what its Pulumi triggers listed (the generation id and tree for Stage, Apply, Probe and BackupShip; the declared identity for Preflight), and the memo hashes no files, so a step re-runs exactly when its rendered input changes. `Command.Exec` keeps no stdout and deletes nothing. That is not a gap here: every script fails closed with a non-zero exit (PREFLIGHT-FAIL, probe mismatches, BACKUP-FAIL receipts), which fails the deploy, and the step's stdout still streams to the deploy log. Nothing downstream consumed the stdout outputs. The drift audit, live acceptance and rollback stay operator commands, now stack outputs under `operatorCommands`, and the rollback command is the teardown, since `alchemy destroy` leaves the workstation untouched. `Command.Build` is not used: no step produces a file the stack consumes. The backup passphrase reaches the ship step only through the deploy process environment that `op run` builds, never through props or state (tested).

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p4-hosts

Reverse: Replace each Exec with a repo-owned resource that captures stdout once a step's output must be kept; record the gap first (D16).

### OpenClaw generation renderers move into @beep/infra-hosts; infra re-exports them until P6, 2026-11-13

The pure generation model and every applicator script (about 2,300 lines from `infra/src/OpenClaw.ts`, plus `infra/src/OpenClawArtifacts.ts`) move to `@beep/infra-hosts/OpenClawGeneration` and `/OpenClawArtifacts`, so the Alchemy stack and the Pulumi program render from one copy. `infra/src/OpenClaw.ts` keeps only the Pulumi config mapping and component and re-exports the moved module; `infra/` gains a workspace dependency on `@beep/infra-hosts` and leaves in P6. Changes on the way: the backup target (`host`, `user`, `remoteDir`) loses its machine-specific defaults and is required wherever a backup is configured (the Pulumi mapping now requires the three config keys); messages that said `pulumi up` say `alchemy deploy`; doc examples decode the nested `OpenClawStackArgs` shape the stack's config file uses and name no real machine. The renderer tests moved with the code (`packages/tooling/infra/infra-hosts/test/OpenClawGeneration.test.ts`); the infra copy stays green until P6 deletes it.

Reverse: Move src/OpenClawGeneration.ts and src/OpenClawArtifacts.ts back into infra/src and drop infra's @beep/infra-hosts dependency.

### Phoenix cutover: stop and replace the Compose container, keep and look up its data volume, 2026-11-13

The live Phoenix container is Compose-managed, carries no Alchemy ownership labels, and `Docker.Container` recreates any adopted container whose config hash label is missing, so adopting it by name would replace it anyway. The stack therefore stops and replaces it and keeps the data. The RetireCompose step runs `systemctl --user disable --now ai-metrics-phoenix.service`; the unit's `ExecStop` is `docker compose down` without `-v`, which removes the container and the Compose network and keeps the named volume `beep-ai-metrics-dankserver_phoenix_data`. It moves the unit file into `<legacy config root>/retired-compose/`, reloads the user manager, refuses to continue if a Compose-labelled container named `beep-ai-metrics-phoenix` survived, and checks that the volume exists. The new container takes the same name and mounts the same volume at the same path, so Phoenix reads the same data. The volume is a `Docker.Volume.lookup`, not an adopted `Docker.Volume`: an adopted Compose volume carries Compose labels, `Volume`'s diff replaces (delete first) on any label difference, and the data is irreplaceable; a lookup is never deleted, and a missing volume fails the plan instead of mounting an empty one (tested). Downtime is the gap between `compose down` and the healthy container, about a minute. Rollback order matters because both containers share one name: save the `rollbackToCompose` operator command from the stack output, `alchemy destroy --stage prod` (removes the Alchemy container, network and context; the lookup leaves the volume alone), then run the saved command, which restores the archived unit and starts Compose against the same volume. Running it before the destroy would let the destroy delete the restored Compose container. Before the cutover the live session snapshots the volume with Phoenix stopped (runbook).

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p4-hosts

Reverse: Save operatorCommands.rollbackToCompose from the prod stack output, run alchemy destroy --stage prod (removes the Alchemy container, network and context; the looked-up volume stays), then run the saved command: it restores the archived unit and starts it, and docker compose up reattaches the same named volume.

### Pulumi stack beep-storybook/production is removed; it held no resources, 2026-11-13

The Pulumi Storybook program was never applied: `pulumi stack ls` in `infra/storybook` (backend `s3://oip-law-pulumi-state`) showed `production` with 0 resources, last updated five months ago. `pulumi stack export --stack production` was archived 2026-11-13 outside the repo at `~/.local/state/beep/infra-archives/pulumi-exports/beep-storybook-production-2026-11-13.json` (493 bytes, deployment version 3, 0 resources, 0 pending operations, sha256 `fde291a6f1488725c2dd0285b4bd25491578b95deb4d8e9b0823dd33f2448bbf`). `pulumi stack rm production --yes` runs after this decision merges. There is nothing to destroy and nothing to flip. The program sources (`infra/storybook`, `infra/src/Storybook.ts`) leave with the rest of `infra/` in P6; the Vercel config file beside the Storybook app is deleted now because no Vercel project reads it.

Reverse: From infra/storybook under AWS_PROFILE=elpresidank-vault: pulumi stack init production, then pulumi stack import --file ~/.local/state/beep/infra-archives/pulumi-exports/beep-storybook-production-2026-11-13.json.

### storybook-prod GitHub environment and its state-role subject are bootstrap singletons, 2026-11-13

Created 2026-11-13 for `.github/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml`, by hand because `@beep/infra-github` does not exist yet: GitHub environment `storybook-prod` (custom branch policy, `main` only), its variable `ALCHEMY_STATE_ROLE_ARN`, and its secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (piped from the 1Password references the `beep-effect-web-prod` environment uses, values never printed). The trust policy of role `beep-alchemy-state-rw` now lists two subjects: `repo:beep-effect/beep-effect:environment:beep-effect-web-prod` and `repo:beep-effect/beep-effect:environment:storybook-prod`. The Cloudflare token can read the zone's Worker routes (none existed before this stack); the first prod deploy proves the write. `@beep/infra-github` adopts the environment, variable and secrets when it lands (D20).

Reverse: gh api -X DELETE repos/beep-effect/beep-effect/environments/storybook-prod; set the beep-alchemy-state-rw trust policy sub condition back to the single beep-effect-web-prod subject with aws iam update-assume-role-policy.

### Storybook is served at beep-effect.com/storybook through a zone route, 2026-11-13

The `Storybook` stack (`apps/storybook/alchemy.run.ts`) is a `Cloudflare.Website.StaticSite` whose `prod` Worker has no custom domain and no workers.dev URL: one zone route, `beep-effect.com/storybook*`, puts it in front of the apex Worker. The trailing wildcard is deliberate: a route pattern is matched against the whole URL, query string included, and cannot contain one, so an exact `beep-effect.com/storybook` pattern would miss the bare slug with a query (review thread on #3289). The 2026-10-20 public-origin ruling makes `beep-effect.com` the single origin and reserves the `storybook` slug in `@beep/public-site` (`SiteRoute`), so a subdomain would contradict the route map. The build writes to `site/storybook`, so every asset path already carries the route prefix and the Worker needs no script. The prod Worker name is pinned (`beep-storybook-prod`) because a generated name comes from a state-held instance id (the #3133 lesson). `memo: false`: stories live in sibling workspace packages outside the default memo scope, so the build runs on each deploy and the Worker changes only when the output does. Proof before prod: stage `dev_elpresidank` deployed 2026-11-13 (568 assets); `/storybook` redirects to `/storybook/`, `/storybook/` and `/storybook/index.json` return 200, `/storybook/iframe.html?…` redirects to `/storybook/iframe?…` with the query intact, an unknown asset and `/` return 404. The stage was destroyed afterwards.

Lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p3-storybook

Reverse: Remove the routes from apps/storybook/alchemy.run.ts and give the Worker a domain (or workers.dev) instead; alchemy destroy --stage prod removes the Worker and its route.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pulumi stays installed per stack until that stack's cutover | `infra/` | packet owner | destroy needs the CLI and program | the stack's `pulumi destroy` receipt |
| `@beep/infra-hosts` prod deploys from the operator workstation, never CI | one stack | packet owner | dankserver is reachable only over the YubiKey SSH route; S3 state lease is the overlap guard (D21) | a runner with a scoped deploy key to dankserver |
