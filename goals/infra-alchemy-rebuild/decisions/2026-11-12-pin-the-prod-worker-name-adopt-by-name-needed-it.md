title: "Pin the prod Worker name; adopt-by-name needed it"
date: 2026-11-12
lane: "fix/beep-effect-web-prod-worker-name"
reversal: "Remove productionWorkerName from apps/beep-effect-web/alchemy.run.ts once the S3 state holds a completed Website record; the generated name then stays authoritative."

Amends the decision 'BeepEffectWeb moves to the S3 store by code change only'. Its premise, that the first prod deploy against the empty S3 stage reads every resource by name and adopts silently, did not hold for the Worker: Alchemy names a Worker {stack}-{stage}-{id}-{instanceId} with a random instance id kept in state, so the empty stage minted beepeffectweb-website-prod-cbwmlwzgibgw7skx. That Worker could not take beep-effect.com from the live beepeffectweb-website-prod-lu7dco5dnf2llcs2, and Deploy beep-effect-web (prod) failed on every push from #3021 (2026-11-09) to 2026-11-12. Both Workers carry the alchemy:stack:BeepEffectWeb, alchemy:stage:prod and alchemy:id:Website tags (read 2026-11-12), and the S3 record is a creating checkpoint without attributes. With the prod name pinned, the planner's recovery read finds the orphan, the explicit name forces a replace, the replacement observes the live Worker as owned and adopts it without --adopt, and the replace then deletes the orphan. Agent-proposed with the operator's go-ahead on 2026-11-12.
