title: "storybook-prod GitHub environment and its state-role subject are bootstrap singletons"
date: 2026-11-13
lane: "goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p3-storybook"
reversal: "gh api -X DELETE repos/beep-effect/beep-effect/environments/storybook-prod; set the beep-alchemy-state-rw trust policy sub condition back to the single beep-effect-web-prod subject with aws iam update-assume-role-policy."

Created 2026-11-13 for `.github/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml`, by hand because `@beep/infra-github` does not exist yet: GitHub environment `storybook-prod` (custom branch policy, `main` only), its variable `ALCHEMY_STATE_ROLE_ARN`, and its secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (piped from the 1Password references the `beep-effect-web-prod` environment uses, values never printed). The trust policy of role `beep-alchemy-state-rw` now lists two subjects: `repo:beep-effect/beep-effect:environment:beep-effect-web-prod` and `repo:beep-effect/beep-effect:environment:storybook-prod`. The Cloudflare token can read the zone's Worker routes (none existed before this stack); the first prod deploy proves the write. `@beep/infra-github` adopts the environment, variable and secrets when it lands (D20).
