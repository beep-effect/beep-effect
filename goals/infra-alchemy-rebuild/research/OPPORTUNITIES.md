# Infra Alchemy rebuild: friction receipts

Receipts recorded while the work happened. Secrets, home paths and machine
identifiers are redacted.

## 2026-11-13: Alchemy's provider shape trips two repo-wide Effect diagnostics

- **Doing:** P2 `@beep/alchemy-vercel` (lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p2-vercel).
- **Evidence:** `tsrs -p tsconfig.json` on the new package failed with
  `effect(lazyEffect)` on every `XProvider = () => Provider.succeed(...)` and on
  `providers = () => Layer...` (Alchemy's own convention), and with
  `effect(missingPipeableSignature)` on `export const Project = Resource<Project>("Vercel.Project")`,
  because Alchemy's resource constructor has an `(id, Effect<props>)` overload.
  Both rules are `off` upstream and `error` in `tsconfig.base.json`, and
  `@effect-diagnostics` directives are banned outside two root files. The
  package exports constant layers and a narrowed `DeclaredResource<R>` type.
- **Would have prevented it:** a documented repo pattern for exporting
  third-party constructor shapes (Alchemy resources, platforms) that the
  `missingPipeableSignature` rule cannot model, or a rule option that
  ignores exported values typed by a dependency.

## 2026-11-13: Vitest loads `alchemy` twice, so `Unowned` reads look owned

- **Doing:** the adoption tests for the same package.
- **Evidence:** `stack.deploy` over a seeded, never-deployed project
  succeeded instead of failing with `OwnedBySomeoneElse`. The provider
  (transformed by Vite) imported `alchemy/AdoptPolicy` through the `default`
  export condition (`lib/*.js`), while the engine, loaded natively through
  `@alchemy.run/test`, used the `bun` condition (`src/*.ts`); the `Unowned`
  brand is a module-private symbol, so the engine never saw it. Fixed with
  `server.deps.inline: [/alchemy/]` in the package's `vitest.config.ts`.
- **Would have prevented it:** a shared vitest preset for packages that test
  Alchemy providers (inline `alchemy` and `@alchemy.run/*`), or a note in the
  alchemy-provider skill's testing section.

## 2026-11-13: the test harness types every engine error as `any`

- **Doing:** the same tests.
- **Evidence:** `tsrs -p tsconfig.test.json` reported 29
  `effect(anyUnknownInErrorContext)` errors on `stack.deploy(...)`,
  `stack.destroy()` and `provider.read(...)`, whose error channels are `any`
  in `@alchemy.run/test` and `alchemy/Provider`. The tests go through a typed
  view (`test/harness/Harness.ts` `typed`, `test/harness/Readers.ts`).
- **Would have prevented it:** a shared typed wrapper for the Alchemy test
  harness in a test-kit package, reused by every `@beep/alchemy-*` library.

## 2026-11-13: fallow ignores `test/fixtures/`, so test-only dependencies look unused

- **Doing:** the same package's final-check.
- **Evidence:** `fallow dead-code` reported `@alchemy.run/test` as an unused dev
  dependency of `@beep/alchemy-vercel`; its only importer was
  `test/fixtures/Harness.ts`, and `.fallowrc.jsonc` ignores `**/test/fixtures/**`.
  The harness moved to `test/harness/`.
- **Would have prevented it:** a note in the effect-vitest new-test-file
  checklist that `test/fixtures/` is invisible to fallow, so shared harness
  modules that import packages belong elsewhere.
## 2026-11-13: `A.makeBy(0, f)` returns one element

- **Doing:** P2 `@beep/alchemy-github-runners` scale-up tests (lane
  goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p2-github-runners).
- **Evidence:** the on-demand failover test failed with one `CreateFleet`
  request instead of two. The fake EC2 launched `A.makeBy(count, f)` instances
  and `A.makeBy(0, f)` returns `[f(0)]`: the result is a `NonEmptyArray`, so a
  zero count is clamped to one. The fake reported a full launch and the
  failover branch never ran.
- **Would have prevented it:** a `Gotchas` line on `effect/Array.makeBy` in the
  repo's Effect notes, or a lint that flags `makeBy` with a count that can be 0.

## 2026-11-13: opaque schema classes do not satisfy `S.Codec<A, I>` inference

- **Doing:** the same package, a generic Lambda-boundary helper that decodes a
  runtime config with the schema it is given.
- **Evidence:** typing the parameter `S.Codec<C, CI>` and passing an
  `S.Opaque` class failed with `Property 'brand' is missing` (the inferred `C`
  is the struct's type, not the opaque class). Typing it
  `SC extends S.Codec<unknown, unknown, never, never>` and using `SC["Type"]`
  works.
- **Would have prevented it:** the schema-first skill showing the generic
  signature for helpers that take an opaque schema.

## 2026-11-13: distilled GitHub rc.18 has no App authentication

- **Doing:** the GitHub App live layer of the same package.
- **Evidence:** `@distilled.cloud/github@1.0.0-rc.18` exports `Credentials`
  (bearer token only); the `App` module that mints JWTs and installation tokens
  exists on distilled `main` but not in rc.18, so the package signs the RS256
  JWT itself with WebCrypto, including a PKCS#1 to PKCS#8 key wrapper.
- **Would have prevented it:** a distilled bump that ships the App module; the
  package's `WebCrypto.signAppJwt` is then deleted (decision file
  `2026-11-13-app-jwts-are-signed-with-webcrypto-...`).

**Update, same day:** #3278 moved the distilled family to `1.0.0-rc.19`, which ships `@distilled.cloud/github/App`;
the package now uses `App.appJwt` and the hand-rolled signer is gone. The receipt stands for the hours lost
to the gap between the reference checkout (main) and the pinned release.

## 2026-11-13: SAST flags a PEM template that wraps a test-generated key

- **Doing:** PR #3291 hosted SAST.
- **Evidence:** semgrep `beep-hardcoded-private-key` blocked on a test helper that formats a key generated at
  test time (`crypto.subtle.generateKey`) into a PEM whose header and footer were string literals; no key
  material was committed. Assembling the label at runtime clears it.
- **Would have prevented it:** a local `sast` step in `package-verify`, or a note in the test checklist that PEM
  header and footer literals trip the rule even around generated keys.
## 2026-11-13: vitest loads two copies of Alchemy, so `Unowned` stops refusing

- **Doing:** P2 aws-extras lane, the adopt test for `RunnerLaunchTemplate`
  under `@alchemy.run/test` (`test.provider`, `inMemoryState()`).
- **Evidence:** a same-name launch template without Alchemy's ownership tags
  was adopted on a plain `stack.deploy`, with no `adopt(true)`. Instrumenting
  `read` showed it returned `Unowned(attrs)` while `AdoptPolicy` resolved to
  `false`. The planner checks the brand with `Unowned.is`, keyed by a
  module-private symbol, and vitest had loaded the engine (through
  `@alchemy.run/test`) separately from the package source that imports
  `alchemy/AdoptPolicy`. Inlining `alchemy` and `@alchemy.run/*` with
  `test.server.deps.inline` in the package `vitest.config.ts` fixed it: the
  deploy then fails with `OwnedBySomeoneElse`.
- **Would have prevented it:** a shared vitest preset for `@beep/alchemy-*`
  packages that inlines Alchemy, or an upstream `Unowned` brand registered
  with `Symbol.for`. Sibling lanes (vercel, github-runners) need the same
  config, or their adopt tests pass for the wrong reason.

## 2026-11-13: repo Effect diagnostics reject Alchemy's provider idioms

- **Doing:** the same lane, typing the resources and providers.
- **Evidence:** `tsrs -p tsconfig.json` reports
  `effect(missingPipeableSignature)` on every exported `Resource(...)` value
  (Alchemy's `(id, Effect<props>)` overload), `effect(lazyEffect)` on
  `XProvider = () => Provider.succeed(...)` and `providers = () => Layer...`,
  and `effect(anyUnknownInErrorContext)` on every `stack.deploy(...)` in
  tests, because `ScratchStack` types failures as `any`. Diagnostic
  directives are banned by the quality gate. The workarounds: export each
  resource through a narrowed `ExtrasResource` interface, make providers
  Layer constants, and give tests a `TypedStack` view of the scratch stack
  (`test/support/FakeAws.ts`). About an hour went to this.
- **Would have prevented it:** a short `@beep/alchemy-*` section in the
  `alchemy-provider` skill naming these three shapes, or one shared
  internal helper package the three P2 libraries import.

## 2026-11-13: a cache-baseline re-record has to review root drift inherited from `main`

- **Doing:** P3 Storybook stack (lane `goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p3-storybook`); a new script in
  `apps/storybook/package.json` drifted eight `@beep/storybook` computations.
- **Evidence:** `bun run beep cache baseline --request <request.json>` with `subjects: ["@beep/storybook"]`
  answered `Baseline review does not cover the changed subjects. Unreviewed: //.` The lane does not touch
  `turbo.json`; four PRs merged after the last record (#3242) had regenerated ten root-declared
  `@beep/repo-cli#lint:policy-fingerprint:*` input lists, which `main` reports only as
  `REVIEW configuration-source-drift: turbo.json`. The next lane to re-record inherits the review.
- **Would have prevented it:** the PR that regenerates root `turbo.json` input lists re-records `//` itself
  (make the source drift a BLOCK there), or the baseline command names inherited subjects apart from the
  lane's own so the reviewer knows which diff to read.

## 2026-11-13: `final-check` coverage replays the whole repo when `bun.lock` changes

- **Doing:** the same lane; the diff adds three dependencies to one app, so `bun.lock` gains four lines.
- **Evidence:** `final-check:coverage` selected the full workspace (`coverage:full`, shard 2 of the run) and
  was killed after 36 minutes with exit 143; the other gates took under seven minutes each. The receipt for
  the pushed head records the gate as skipped and hosted CI measures it.
- **Would have prevented it:** scope the coverage replay by the workspaces whose resolved dependencies
  changed in the lockfile diff, not by the lockfile path alone.

## 2026-11-14: the Pulumi passphrase in 1Password does not decrypt the oip-web stacks

- **Doing:** P4 oip-web census (lane goals/infra-alchemy-rebuild-p4-oip-web), reading where the HubSpot
  service key lives today.
- **Evidence:** `pulumi config get oipWeb:hubSpotServiceKey --stack production` (and `staging`) under
  `PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE=op://BEEP_SECRETS/BEEP_SECRETS/PULUMI_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE op run --` exits 1 with
  `error: incorrect passphrase`; plain config reads on the same stacks work. The value is also stored in
  Vercel as `sensitive`, which the API never returns, so no recorded copy of the live key is readable.
- **Would have prevented it:** a check that every Pulumi project's `encryptionsalt` decrypts with the
  1Password passphrase (run when the passphrase or a stack changes), and a 1Password field per runtime secret
  so the IaC copy is never the only one.
- **Correction (packet gate session, 2026-11-14):** the oip-web stacks decrypt with
  `op://BEEP_SECRETS/OIP_SECRETS/PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE`; the `BEEP_SECRETS` item's passphrase belongs to
  the runners stack. The live HubSpot token is `op://BEEP_SECRETS/OIP_SECRETS/CRM_HUBSPOT_SERVICE_KEY` and equals
  the value both stacks held. The receipt stands as friction: the lane had no pointer from the Pulumi project to its
  1Password item.

## 2026-11-14: Alchemy persists a `Redacted` prop's plain text in state

- **Doing:** the same lane, designing how the HubSpot key reaches Vercel without entering state.
- **Evidence:** `alchemy/src/State/StateEncoding.ts` writes `Redacted<T>` as `{ "__redacted__": <inner> }`
  "so the actual string is persisted rather than the `<redacted>` placeholder"; `@beep/alchemy-vercel`'s
  `EnvVar.value` prop was documented as "redacted in state and logs". Any secret passed as `value` lands in
  the state bucket in clear JSON (SSE-KMS at rest only). The lane added `valueFrom: { config }`, resolved in
  `diff` and `reconcile`, with only a SHA-256 kept in state.
- **Would have prevented it:** an Alchemy-level deferred secret input (resolved at apply time, digest in
  state) so every provider gets the property, and a harness assertion in provider tests that no `Redacted`
  value appears in persisted state.

## 2026-11-14: `alchemy plan` lines in CI carry a logger prefix

- **Doing:** the same lane, writing the pre-deploy plan check.
- **Evidence:** the `dev_$USER` plan printed `[20:33:03.096] INFO: [Project] create`, not the bare
  `[Project] create` that `formatPlanLines` renders; a parser anchored at line start found no `Plan:` summary
  and failed closed. Only a real plan run showed it.
- **Would have prevented it:** a machine-readable plan output (`alchemy plan --json`, or a documented
  changes-pending exit code, open question 9 of the P0 matrix).

## 2026-11-14: the Alchemy Cloudflare token cannot read the oip.law zones' DNS records

- **Doing:** the same lane, census of the Pulumi-owned DNS records.
- **Evidence:** with `CLOUD_CLOUDFLARE_ALCHEMY_TOKEN`, `GET /zones/<id>` succeeds for both zones and
  `GET /zones/<id>/dns_records` returns 403; `CLOUD_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_IAC_TOKEN` reads them. Of the two
  Vercel fields, `CLOUD_VERCEL_TOKEN` reads the team and `CLOUD_VERCEL_API_TOKEN` returns 403 on every call.
- **Would have prevented it:** a token inventory naming each 1Password field's scope, checked by a
  read-only probe per stack before a lane starts.
